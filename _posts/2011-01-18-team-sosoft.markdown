title: The Birth of Team Sosoft
---

Last november, I experienced the first [Codapalooza](http://www.codapalooza.com "Codapalooza One") as part of [team Sosoft](http://codapalooza.com/teams/pyxis-sosoft/ "Sosoft at Codapalooza One"). This was the first event of its kind in Montreal. And it was amazing!  Xavier already [shared our experience as a team](http://xtothoughts.blogspot.com/2010/11/codapalooza-one-fun-with-purpose.html).

It was so much fun coding day and night in ruby using Rails 3 that we decided to carry on with the development of Hibou. Hibou is a social software designed to help community daycare centers manage their day-to-day operations. What do I mean by social software? Hibou is charity work, which has been driven by the will to help out [Carrefour péri-naissance de St-Eustache](http://www.carrefourperinaissance.org/index.html "Carrefour péri-naissance"). 

Following the Codapalooza, we spent some of our spare time to give the application a decent look and feel and pack a bit more features. The latest Hibou is now [available on Heroku](http://hibou.heroku.com "Hibou on Heroku"). We've also made the source code [available on Github](http://github.com/sosoft/hibou "Hibou on Github"). I plan to talk about what we've learned in a near future.

The next step now is to release version 1.0 of Hibou so that Carrefour péri-naissance can start using Hibou on a daily basis. You can track our progress on our [product backlog](https://www.pyxis-tech.ca/jira/browse/SFT "Hibou's backlog"). One thing you'll probably notice is that it's a bug-free backlog. Want to know more about bug-free backlogs? Nicholas blogged extensively about it [here](http://nicholaslemay.blogspot.com/2010/12/finally-solution-for-bug-free-backlog.html "Part 1"), [here](http://nicholaslemay.blogspot.com/2010/12/finally-solution-for-bug-free.html "Part 2") and [here](http://nicholaslemay.blogspot.com/2011/01/finally-solution-for-bug-free.html "Part 3").
