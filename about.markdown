## About me

Iâ€™m a software developer in Montreal at [Pyxis Technologies](http://www.pyxis-tech.com). I work to shape a world of software development where quality of work joins quality of life in creating products that matter.

When I'm not programming, I'm usually teaching or coaching on Scrum and iterative and incremental development. I've started using XP over 10 years ago and Scrum in 2002. I'm also a Certified Scrum Trainer since 2007.
