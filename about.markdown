## About me

I’m a software  developer in Montreal. I work to shape a world of software development where quality of work joins quality of life in creating products that matter. I'm passionate about what I do.  

When I'm not programming, I'm usually teaching or coaching on Scrum and iterative and incremental development. I've started using XP over 10 years ago and Scrum in 2002. I'm also a Certified Scrum Trainer since 2007.
