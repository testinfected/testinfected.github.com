## About me

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer, Coach and Professional Scrum Trainer living in Montreal. I work to shape a world of software development where quality of work joins quality of life in creating products that matter.

When I'm not coaching teams to be great and produce great software, I'm usually teaching or coaching on Scrum and iterative and incremental development. I've started using XP over in 2000 and Scrum in 2002. I've been a Certified Scrum Trainer at the Scrum Alliance between 2007 and 2010. I'm now a Professional Scrum Trainer at [Scrum.org](http://scrum.org) since 2010.
