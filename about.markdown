## About me

Iâ€™m a software engineer and Professional Scrum Trainer in Montreal at [Pyxis Technologies](http://www.pyxis-tech.com). I work to shape a world of software development where quality of work joins quality of life in creating products that matter.

When I'm not programming, I'm usually teaching or coaching on Scrum and iterative and incremental development. I've started using XP over in 2000 and Scrum in 2002. I've been a Certified Scrum Trainer at the Scrum Alliance between 2007 and 2010. I'm now a Professional Scrum Trainer at [Scrum.org](http://scrum.org).
